                Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer.
                Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.

                It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small suacepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.

                Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.

                Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candided lemon peel.
